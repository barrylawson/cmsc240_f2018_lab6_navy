When compiling to execute, please note that not all machines are compatible with 
our VectorTester code -- the try/catch methods that we used are not available on 
the linux boxes. If you wish to run on the linux boxes or another computer that 
doesn't have the most updated C++ package, the code will run if you just comment 
out the try/catch parts of the code used for testing empty vectors.
